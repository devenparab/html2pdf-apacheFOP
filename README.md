# html2pdf-apacheFOP
This Project converts HTML to PDF with all open source technologies.<br/>
1) This is simple SpringBoot App.
2) It takes **Sampler.html** and converts it to PDF with name **generated.pdf**<br/>
3) The **xhtml2fo.xsl** file understands and converts html to xsl-fo, the xsl file is from **Antenna House**, a company that sells a commercial formatter for XSL-FO. But this file    is free.
